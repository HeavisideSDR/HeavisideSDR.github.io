## Mission

The goal of the HeavisideSDR project is to enable remote HF operation on a small budget.

Many newly licensed amateurs are unable to take advantage of their HF privileges because of the difficulty of erecting an HF antenna
when renting or living in an urban area. HeavisideSDR allows hams to setup a remote station easily and at low-cost,
opening up the thrill of DX and HF operation to many more amateur operators.

### Principles

 >> **Low-Cost:** a traditional remote station could cost upwards of 15kUSD. HeavisideSDR answers the question: what could be done with a total station budget of 150USD?
 >> **Open-Source:** HeavisideSDR hardware uses the TAPR Open Hardware License for the board designs and documentation, and the GNU Public License for the firmware and software utilities.

## Hardware

### HTX-1

The first HSDR board is the HTX-1, a digital HF transmitter.

Tech specs:

 - 5W HF PA
 - 2.4GHz WiFi and Bluetooth
 - supports CW, PSK, and FSK digital modes

## Firmware

All HeavisideSDR boards use a common codebase written in C.
