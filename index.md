## Mission

The goal of the HeavisideSDR project is to enable remote HF operation on a small budget.

Many newly licensed amateurs are unable to take advantage of their HF privileges because of the difficulty of erecting an HF antenna
when renting or living in an urban area. HeavisideSDR allows hams to setup a remote station easily and at low-cost,
opening up the thrill of DX and HF operation to many more amateur operators.

## Hardware

The first HSDR board is the HTX-1, a digital HF transmitter.
